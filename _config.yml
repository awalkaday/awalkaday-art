  Let's embark on a journey through a collection of black and white photographs depicting the natural landscapes and architectural wonders of Belgium (Europe) that will inspire you to get out and walk. <br><br>
  Created by Chris-Armel (daqhris), the photographs pay tribute to the joys of walking in nature and capture fascinating sights discovered, by chance and on foot, in a country of refuge far from tyranny. Feel free to immerse yourself in a self-built digital venue that showcases ageless and time-bound visual memories. <br><br>
  awalkaday.art is an artistic project that has been evolving slowly and publicly since 2017 and then, was suspended a few months later in 2018. It was relaunched in 2021, and the creative process of photographing came to an end a year later, in 2022. The following year, in 2023, a smart contract was self-published on the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate the collection of artworks from this series of 263 photographs.
