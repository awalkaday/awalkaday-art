  Let's explore a collection of black-and-white photographs illustrating the charm of natural landscapes and architectural wonders of Belgium (Europe). 
  Shot by Chris-Armel Iradukunda (daqhris), the photographs honor the joy of walking in nature and capturing fascinating sights, discovered by chance and on foot, in a country of refuge far from tyranny. Feel free to immerse yourself in a self-built web gallery that showcases ageless and time-bound visual memories. <br><br>
  awalkaday.art is a visual arts project that has been slowly and publicly evolving since 2017, until interruption in 2018. The art project was resumed in 2021, and the process of photographing came to an end a year later. The following year, in 2023, a smart contract containing 263 photographs was minted on the Ethereum blockchain and few photos started being listed for sale. In the first half of 2024, a virtual exhibition of 24 photographs was opened to all. From the second half of 2024, an artist's book documenting the photographic odyssey has been drafted online.
