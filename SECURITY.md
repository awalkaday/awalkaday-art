# Security Policy

## Fast & Safe Updates

Security updates are released as soon as a software patch has been implemented.  
Any issue that is risky and well-reported gets our ultimate focus.   
Solutions are __rapidly__ applied in our codebase, web servers or build machines so that any user or visitor feels safer onsite.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, you may send an __encrypted e-mail__ to the [lead developer](https://daqhris.com/contact/).   
Once the issue is fixed, you will be directly notified and thanked.    
Your contribution to the site safety will be publicly acknowledged.
