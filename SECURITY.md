# Security Policy

## Fast & Safe Updates

Security updates are released as soon as a software patch has been implemented.  
Any issue that is deemed risky and well-reported earns the developer's ultimate focus.   
Solutions are __rapidly__ applied in the codebase, web servers or build machines so that any user/visitor feels safe onsite.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, send an __encrypted e-mail__ to the [software developer](https://daqhris.com/contact/).   
Once the issue is fixed, you will be directly notified and thanked.    
Your contribution to the website safety will be publicly acknowledged.
